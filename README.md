# Labyrinth-Navigation

A software project, the aim of which is training how to do software projects.
The interesting part is that we get to use the Malmo Minecraft Project to do a simple labyrinth walking AI-Steve - interesting for us, for now.

So really, not much to see, move on. If it gets any more interesting, we will say so here.
