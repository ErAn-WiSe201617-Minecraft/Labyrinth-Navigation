# Labyrinth-Navigation

A software project for a university course, the aim of which is training how to do software projects.
The interesting part is that we get to use the [Malmo Minecraft Project](http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2016/03/13/project-malmo-using-minecraft-build-intelligent-technology/#sm.0000mxf2wuob2cq3shr2e1zr8le0f) to do a simple labyrinth walking AI-Steve - interesting for us, for now.

So really, not much to see, move on. If it gets any more interesting, we will say so here.
